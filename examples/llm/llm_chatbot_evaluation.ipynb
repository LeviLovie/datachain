    "In LLM applications nowadays, the emerging standard pattern for most use-cases is to employ a pre-trained model with an API from a 3rd party provider and to augment it with a RAG context. On one hand, this means there is not much actual machine learning going on on the user's end. On the other hand naive application of \"latest and greatest\" models with no prompt engineering, testing and evaluation of RAG context can lead to needlessly expensive operational costs at best and dissapointingly poor performance at worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, even if there is no machine learning involved, there is still a lot of fine tuning we need to do and a lot of that involves large datasets (such as histories of chatbot conversations or large collections of company documents). Just like with ML training, we need to version all that data as we finetune our applications to be able to correctly evaluate the effect of any changes we apply to our models. We can experiment with the LLM choice, prompt engineering, the way we process data for our RAG context (pre-processing, embedding, ...) and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will see how we can use DataChain to create such a controlled development environment and how it can help us when we evaluate any fine-tuning of our LLM applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will see how to use DataChain to version our RAG context datasets to preserve reproducibility of our fine-tuning experiments as the RAG context changes. We will also see how to use DataChain in the evaluation of fine-tuning by comparing two different text embedding models and saving (and versioning) the results with additional context."
